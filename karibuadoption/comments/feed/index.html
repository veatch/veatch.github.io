		<description><![CDATA[Teachers are the front line of helping kids through all kinds of chaos. It&#039;s a very high expectation that is not matched by respect or salary in most places, but as you say, it&#039;s a calling, not a job. Because we love our kids, we do what we must to help them. Thank you  and all teachers who are doing what must be done to help kids get through this trauma!]]></description>
